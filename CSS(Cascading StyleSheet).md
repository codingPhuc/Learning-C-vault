# how to used CSS 
CSS can be store in the form of a link or a file in the same directory , the link CSS act like a code file like a import function in C or python 
for a CSS file it can be a hosted on the same cloud server as the HTML, or a different host if you import the CSS style library 

```

{
tabsize : 4
tab_size :4 /property 

}
```
a selector is used to selected the HTML element to apply change the CSS , while the property is the change to be applied to that CSS 
you need to understand the protocol and syntax in a CSS file 

## different type of Selector 
```
.html  // selector 
{
tabsize : 4
tab_size :4 /property 

}
```
element with the `.` in the beginning of the CSS is call a class selector 
```
#html  // selector 
{
tabsize : 4
tab_size :4 /property 

}
```
element with the `#` in the beginning is call the id selector 
when you work on a project remember that : 
- `no special type` is used for most problem 
- `.` is used for problem that may occur 
- `#` is used for niche problem
