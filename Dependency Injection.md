.NET supports the dependency injection (DI) software design pattern, which is a technique for achieving [Inversion of Control (IoC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/architectural-principles#dependency-inversion) between classes and their dependencies. Dependency injection in .NET is a built-in part of the framework, along with configuration, logging, and the options pattern. 
# what is a dependency 
A _dependency_ is an object that another object depends on. Examine the following `MessageWriter` class with a `Write` method that other classes depend on:


```
public class MessageWriter
{
    public void Write(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"MessageWriter.Write(message: \"{message}\")");
    }
}
```

A class can create an instance of the `MessageWriter` class to make use of its `Write` method. In the following example, the `MessageWriter` class is a dependency of the `Worker` class:

```
public class Worker : BackgroundService
{
    private readonly MessageWriter _messageWriter = new();

    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            _messageWriter.Write($"Worker running at: {DateTimeOffset.Now}");
            await Task.Delay(1_000, stoppingToken);
        }
    }
}
```

The class creates and directly depends on the `MessageWriter` class. Hard-coded dependencies, such as in the previous example, are problematic and should be avoided for the following reasons:

- To replace `MessageWriter` with a different implementation, the `Worker` class must be modified.
- If `MessageWriter` has dependencies, they must also be configured by the `Worker` class. In a large project with multiple classes depending on `MessageWriter`, the configuration code becomes scattered across the app.
- This implementation is difficult to unit test. The app should use a mock or stub `MessageWriter` class, which isn't possible with this approach.
# Dependency injection addresses these problems through:

- The use of an interface or base class to abstract the dependency implementation.
- Registration of the dependency in a service container. .NET provides a built-in service container, [IServiceProvider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iserviceprovider). Services are typically registered at the app's start-up and appended to an [IServiceCollection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.iservicecollection). Once all services are added, you use [BuildServiceProvider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.servicecollectioncontainerbuilderextensions.buildserviceprovider) to create the service container.
- _Injection_ of the service into the constructor of the class where it's used. The framework takes on the responsibility of creating an instance of the dependency and disposing of it when it's no longer needed.

# What happen when you create a dependency injection with a singleton service 
When you register `MessageWriter` as a singleton service for the `IMessageWriter` interface in a .NET application, it means that:

- **One Instance**: Only one instance of `MessageWriter` is created by the .NET dependency injection (DI) container.
- **Application Lifetime**: This single instance is used throughout the entire lifetime of the application.
- **Service Request**: Whenever any part of your application requests an `IMessageWriter`, the DI container will provide this single, already-created instance of `MessageWriter`.

Here’s what happens in the application:

1. The application starts and sets up the DI container.
2. The DI container
3. sees the singleton registration and knows that it should only create one instance of `MessageWriter`.
4. The first time an `IMessageWriter` is requested, the DI container creates an instance of `MessageWriter` and keeps it.
5. Any subsequent requests for an `IMessageWriter` will receive the same instance that was created the first time.

This is beneficial when you want to maintain state or share resources across different parts of your application using the same service instance. It also helps in optimizing resource usage since you’re not creating new instances for every request.



```csharp
public interface IMessageWriter
{
    void Write(string message);
}

public class MessageWriter : IMessageWriter
{
    public void Write(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}

// In Startup.cs or Program.cs
services.AddSingleton<IMessageWriter, MessageWriter>();
```

In this code, `MessageWriter` is the concrete implementation of `IMessageWriter`. Because it’s registered as a singleton, only one instance of `MessageWriter` will be created and used every time an `IMessageWriter` is needed.







1. **Dependency Injection (DI)**: This is a technique to achieve Inversion of Control between classes and their dependencies. It allows you to abstract the creation and binding of dependent objects outside of the class that uses them.
    
2. **Interfaces and Concrete Implementations**: An interface like `IMessageWriter` defines a contract (a set of methods without implementation). A concrete class like `MessageWriter` provides the actual implementation of the interface. DI allows you to use the interface `IMessageWriter` throughout your application, and the DI container will provide an instance of `MessageWriter` wherever `IMessageWriter` is required.
    
3. **Service Container**: In .NET, `IServiceProvider` is the built-in service container that is responsible for resolving dependencies. You register services with it, and it creates instances of these services when needed.
    
4. **Singleton Service**: When you register a service as a singleton (`AddSingleton`), it means that only one instance of that service will be created for the entire lifetime of the application. Every time an `IMessageWriter` is needed, the same instance of `MessageWriter` will be provided.
    
5. **Worker Service**: A worker service in .NET is a background service that performs operations in the background while your application is running. When you register a worker service using `AddHostedService<Worker>()`, you’re telling the DI container to create and manage a `Worker` instance as a long-running service. The `Worker` class typically implements the `IHostedService` or `BackgroundService` interface and contains logic that should run in the background, such as processing tasks, monitoring, or batch jobs.
    
6. **Building and Running the Host**: The `HostApplicationBuilder` is used to configure and build the application host. The host is what runs your application and contains the DI service provider. After building the host with `builder.Build()`, calling `host.Run()` starts the application and any registered background services.
    
In summary, the DI container manages the creation and lifecycle of services like `IMessageWriter` and background workers. It ensures that the same instance of a singleton service is used throughout the application, and it instantiates and starts worker services as needed. 


# Example  

1. **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Think of a car factory. Instead of each car assembling its own parts, there’s a separate department that specializes in creating and providing the necessary parts (like engines, wheels, etc.) to the cars on the assembly line. This department is like the DI container, and the car assembly line is like your application.
    
2. **Interfaces and Concrete Implementations**: Imagine a coffee shop where you have a menu (interface) that lists different types of coffee drinks without specifying how they’re made. The barista (concrete implementation) knows how to make each drink on the menu. When you order, you don’t need to know how to make the drink; the barista will prepare it for you, just like how the DI container provides the implementation for an interface.
    
3. **Service Container**: Consider a hospital with a central pharmacy (service container). Doctors prescribe medications (services), but they don’t provide them directly to patients. Instead, the pharmacy dispenses the correct medication (service instance) when a patient presents a prescription.
    
4. **Singleton Service**: This is like having one central printer in an office. No matter who sends a print job, everyone uses the same printer. It’s always available and doesn’t change or get replaced between print jobs.
    
5. **Worker Service**: Think of a worker service as the office’s night shift security guard. While everyone else has gone home, the security guard (worker service) is still there, patrolling the premises and ensuring everything is secure until the morning.
    
6. **Building and Running the Host**: Building a host is like setting up a festival. You arrange the stages, food stalls, and other facilities (services) before the event. When the festival opens (`host.Run()`), everything operates as planned, with music playing and food being served in the background.
    

These analogies should help in understanding the abstract concepts of .NET’s dependency injection system and how it operates in a software environment. If you need further clarification or examples, feel free to ask!
