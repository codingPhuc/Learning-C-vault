# How SSL encrypt data 
- SSL  or Secure Socket Layer , is  an encryption bases Internet security protocol , it was first develop in the 1995 by Netscape 
- it provide  a higer dergee of privacy any decrypting the data will end up with garbled mix 
- SSL initiates an authentication process called a handshake between two communicating devices to ensure that both devices are really who they claim to be 

## Symmetric  Key SSL encryption :  
- A Symmetric key is a key that are used both for the encryption and decryption of data , this implies that in order to decrypt information the same key that used to encrypt it much be used 
- it is like a shared secret between two or more person to establish  a connection

## ASYMMETRIC KEY ? 
- Asymmetric keys are the cornerstone of puclic key infrastrucutre (PKI), an encrytion techique that requires two keys , one to lock or encrypt the plaintext and another to unlock or decrypt the cyphertext. Neither key performs both functions 
- used two keys for it encryption process , the public key used for encryption and private key used for decryption 
- A public key is available for anyone who needs to encrypt a piece of information . This key doesn't work for the decryption process the user need a second key the private key to decrypt the information , this ensure that there is no security threat when dealing with upscaling
